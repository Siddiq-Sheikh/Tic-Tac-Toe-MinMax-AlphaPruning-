# Tic Tac Toe with AI (Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning)

This project implements a classic **Tic Tac Toe** game featuring two types of AI opponents:
- **Minimax Bot** (full minimax algorithm)
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning Bot** (optimized minimax with pruning)

Players can either compete against the bots or watch two bots play each other.

## How It Works

- The game board is a 3x3 grid initialized with empty spaces.
- Players ('X' or 'O') alternate turns until someone wins or the game ends in a draw.
- **Minimax** explores all moves to select the optimal strategy.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning** optimizes minimax by eliminating unnecessary calculations.
